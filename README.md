# This is a burger builder app

In this app you can make your burger, add cheese, meat, salad and order that burger.

You can visit the live site by clicking [here](https://burger-builder-59.netlify.app/).

The project is built with:
    <ul>
        <li>React js</li>
        <li>Redux</li>
        <li>Firebase</li>
    </ul>

Besides, I have used a few node packages in this project.
